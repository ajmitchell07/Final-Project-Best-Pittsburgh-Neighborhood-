### Project Description
We are analyzing which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the best based on safety. We are using three different safety metrics, including non-traffic citations, firearm seizures, and monthly criminal activity.

**Datasets Used:**
<br>
Non-Traffic Citations: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/6b11e87d-1216-463d-bbd3-37460e539d86<br>
This dataset keeps track of the low-level criminal offenses that have occurred throughout Pittsburgh. This dataset only contains information reported by the City of Pittsburgh Police.
<br>
Firearm Seizures: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/e967381d-d7e9-48e3-a2a2-39262f7fa5c4
This dataset shows the amount of guns that have been seized by the Pittsburgh police per address and neighborhood. It also shows the type of gun that was seized.
<br>
Monthly Criminal Activity: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/monthly-criminal-activity-dashboard <br>
This data set calculates the monthly criminal activity in each Pittsburgh neighborhood, including the specific type and category each crime belongs to.



### Repository Overview
This project is meant to use data from the WPRDC to determine the "best" neighborhood based on a certain set of qualifications.
