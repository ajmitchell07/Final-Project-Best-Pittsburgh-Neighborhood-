    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project I'm tasked with identifying and proving which is the \"best\" neighborhood in Pittsburgh using a data set that's collected from each neighborhood in Pittsburgh. I was originally going to use a metric that collected SNAP data from each neighborhood or a metric that reported landslide prone areas, but I ultimately chose a metric based on the monthly criminal activity in each neighborhood as my group and I decided to chose metrics based on safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Metric\n",
    "My metric calculates the monthly criminal activity in each Pittsburgh neighborhood The features my metric is measuring is the date that the crime report was created, the time it was reported, the reported day of the week, the reported month, the offense category, the offense type, the crime against, the violation, and most importantly the neighborhood the crime occured.
