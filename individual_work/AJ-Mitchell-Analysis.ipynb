    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project I'm tasked with identifying and proving which is the \"best\" neighborhood in Pittsburgh using a data set that's collected from each neighborhood in Pittsburgh. I was originally going to use a metric that collected SNAP data from each neighborhood or a metric that reported landslide prone areas, but I ultimately chose a metric based on the monthly criminal activity in each neighborhood as my group and I decided to chose metrics based on safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Metric\n",
    "The metric I decided to use to measure the best Pittsburgh neighborhood is meausring how safe each neighborhood is, the safer the neighborhood the better the neighborhood. My dataset calculates the monthly criminal activity in each Pittsburgh neighborhood The features my metric is measuring is the date that the crime report was created, the time it was reported, the reported day of the week, the reported month, the offense category, the offense type, the crime against, the violation, and most importantly the neighborhood the crime occured. The other datasets used calculates the air quality and non traffic citations of each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Best Neighborhood\n",
    "In context of my metric and my dataset the best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh is Saint Clair. I believe Saint Clair is the best neighborhood as Saint Clair has the lowest average crime this year at 10.417 crimes and the lowest amount of crimes this year at 125 crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The data driven determination that Saint Clair is the \"best neighborhood\" is completely different from my personal favorite neighborhoods, Oakland and around Allgheny West/Perry South. This is due to the fact that I've never heard or even been to Saint Clair, compared to Oakland where Pitt is located and Allgheny West/Perry South where I grew up going to, to visit family."
