    "# Introduction\n",
    "Introduce the project, and your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Metric\n",
    "Describe your metric, and what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Best Neighborhood\n",
    "Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this."
