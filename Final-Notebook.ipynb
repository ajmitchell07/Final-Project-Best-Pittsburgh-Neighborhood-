    "## Final Notebook\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "When trying to find the \"best neighborhood\" in Pittsburgh, our group decided upon safety as our metric. We all agreed that safety is a vital component to the quality of a neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Metric\n",
    "Specifically for our metrics, we decided to look at non-traffic citations, firearm seizures, and monthly criminal activity. Before landing upon these metrics, some other metrics we were considering were air quality, landslide-prone areas, and fire incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Best Neighborhood\n",
    "According to all of our metrics combined, we decided that Chartiers is the best neighborhood. Chartiers has the lowest monthly average crime rate and thirtd-lowest total crimes reported since 2024. There has also been no firearm seizure incidents, and it's one of the few neighborhoods with the lowest amount of non-traffic citations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "**Abigail:**\n",
    "The data-driven determination of the \"best neighborhood\" is different from my personal favorite neighborhood, Shadyside, which has a large number of citations. Despite it being less \"safe,\" I love to go to Shadyside as a fun weekend outing, whether it's to eat, shop, or just walk around.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AJ:**\n",
    "The data driven determination of the \"best neighborhood\" is completely different from my personal favorite neighborhood, the Strip District, despite the numerous amount of crimes reported there. Even though Chartiers is \"safer,\" I've never heard or ever been there compared to Strip District which has all the shops I love going to, it's nice to walk around in, and I have extended family that live close to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Lakshya:**\n",
    "the data-driven determination of the \"best neighborhood\" is different from my personal favorite neighborhood. My favorite neighborhood is North Shore, which actually has had a higher number of firearm seizures compared to other neighborhoods. They have had 20 incidents of gun seizures, therefore being labeled as unsafe according to my analyzation. However, I have been here a couple of times and I haven't felt that unsafe. I don't think you can generalize an entire neighborhood as unsafe based off of one factor."
